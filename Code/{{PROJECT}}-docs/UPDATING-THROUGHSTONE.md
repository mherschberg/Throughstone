# Updating Throughstone

Use this when you want to compare a bootstrapped project against a newer Throughstone
template release and decide whether to bring over scaffold improvements.

Trigger phrases:
- "check for Throughstone updates"
- "update the scaffold"
- "compare this project to the latest Throughstone template"

This is **scaffold/method maintenance**, not a created-project runbook. Runbooks cover the
project you are building; this file covers the Throughstone machinery copied into that
project. If an update changes method rules, agent behavior, collaboration rules, CI, or
multiple repos, turn it into a tracked STEP before applying it.

## 1. Principles

- **Default to advisory.** The first action is always a report, not a write.
- **Do not treat unchanged-local as safe.** It only means the file can be replaced without a
  text merge; the behavioral risk may still be high.
- **Project state is protected.** Never automatically update architecture docs, ADRs,
  project overview, STEP history, application code, or stamped/generated repo files.
- **The updater is stateless.** If updater tooling exists, project state lives in a manifest
  in the docs hub; update logic may change upstream, but it must read state from disk.
- **Do not run surprise remote code.** Manual comparison does not require signatures or
  checksums. If future tooling executes downloaded updater code, pin the release/ref and verify
  it using the provenance mechanism that release publishes.
- **Make rollback boring.** Apply updates only when every affected repo has a clean working
  tree and index, use the branch required by this guide, and keep the report with the change.

## 2. File Buckets

| Bucket | Examples | Update policy |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Tools / scripts** | `scripts/status.sh`, `scripts/check.sh`, `scripts/setup-workspace.sh` | Review required. May be replaced when local still matches the installed baseline, but still report behavioral implications. |
| **Process docs** | `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`, `runbooks/*.md`, `coding-standards/*.md` | Review required. Changes may alter how contributors or agents work. Apply as a coherent group when files reference each other. |
| **Templates for future use** | `templates/*.md`, `templates/architecture-sessions/*.md`, `templates/ci/*.yml` | Future-only by default. Updating them affects newly generated docs/sessions/repos; it does not rewrite existing generated outputs. |
| **Stamped/generated files** | repo `README.md`, copied CI workflows, `.env.example`, STEP plans | Project-owned after creation. Never auto-update; provide advisory diffs only if explicitly requested. |
| **Project state** | `overview.md`, `architecture/`, `adr/`, `prompts/`, application code repos | Never auto-update from upstream Throughstone. Changes happen through the normal method: sessions, ADRs, STEPs, and check-ins. |

## 3. Manual Mode

This guide works today even without updater tooling, a project manifest, or an upstream update
catalog.

1. Pick the target Throughstone release or commit from
   `https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone`.
2. Read the target release notes / `CHANGELOG.md` and identify the scaffold/process changes
   you may want.
3. Compare only scaffold/process material: `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   `UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`, `templates/`, `runbooks/`, `coding-standards/`, and
   `scripts/`.
4. Treat the file buckets in §2 as the authority. Never manually copy protected project state
   from upstream.
5. For each candidate change, write a short report: target release/ref, files reviewed,
   implication/risk, recommendation, and whether it needs a tracked STEP.
6. Apply only the reviewed changes the user explicitly approves, following the apply and STEP
   rules in §8 and §10, then run `scripts/check.sh`.

Manual mode is slower than tooling, but it is the default path until the manifest and catalog
described below exist.

## 4. Future Tooling Artifacts

A future updater should read two kinds of metadata.

### Project Manifest

The manifest lives in the docs hub at `Code/{{PROJECT}}-docs/.throughstone/manifest.yml`
when viewed from the workspace root. Within the docs hub, that same path is
`.throughstone/manifest.yml`.

The default upstream source is `https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone`. If a project
intentionally tracks a fork or private mirror instead, record that source in the manifest so
future checks compare against the right upstream.

```yaml
# .throughstone/manifest.yml
throughstone:
  installed_version: "0.1.0"
  installed_ref: "abc1234"
  source: "https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone"

files:
  - local_path: "METHOD.md"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "METHOD.md"
    kind: "process"
    policy: "review"
    installed_sha256: "..."

  - local_path: "scripts/status.sh"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "scripts/status.sh"
    kind: "script"
    policy: "review"
    installed_sha256: "..."

  - local_path: "templates/substep-prompt.md"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "templates/substep-prompt.md"
    kind: "template"
    policy: "future-only"
    installed_sha256: "..."
```

Manifest field meanings:

- `local_path` is relative to the initialized docs hub. For example,
  `Code/acme-docs/scripts/status.sh` on disk is recorded as `scripts/status.sh`.
- `upstream_area` names the logical scaffold area in the Throughstone source. For now, this
  guide only defines `docs-hub`, which maps to upstream `Code/{{PROJECT}}-docs/`.
- `upstream_path` is relative to `upstream_area`. For example, `upstream_area: "docs-hub"` plus
  `upstream_path: "scripts/status.sh"` maps to upstream
  `Code/{{PROJECT}}-docs/scripts/status.sh`.
- Future tooling combines `source`, `installed_ref`, `upstream_area`, and `upstream_path` to
  find the upstream file, and combines the initialized docs hub path with `local_path` to find
  the local file.

Keep upstream identifiers placeholder-free. Do not store the initialized project slug in an
upstream path, and do not depend on the Throughstone project-placeholder token surviving
bootstrap; `init.sh` intentionally replaces it in file contents.

The manifest is advisory state, not magic truth. If it is missing, stale, or inconsistent,
the updater must say so and fall back to a manual comparison.

### Upstream Update Catalog

Once updater tooling exists, each Throughstone release should ship an update catalog:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0"
changes:
  - area: "docs-hub"
    path: "scripts/setup-workspace.sh"
    group: "workspace-setup"
    kind: "script"
    risk: "medium"
    summary: "Improves repo registry parsing when only some repos have remotes."
    implications:
      - "Changes clone behavior for multi-repo workspaces."
      - "Does not modify project docs or application code."
    recommendation: "Review, then apply if setup-workspace.sh was not customized."

  - area: "docs-hub"
    path: "templates/planning-session.md"
    group: "planning-flow"
    kind: "template"
    risk: "low"
    summary: "Adds stronger CI scaffolding guidance."
    implications:
      - "Affects future planning sessions only."
      - "Does not update existing STEP plans."
    recommendation: "Update for future use."
```

Catalog entries must name implications plainly. The updater should also compute mechanical
risk signals instead of relying only on maintainer-written summaries.

## 5. Compare Model

For every scaffold-managed file, compare three versions:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **base** | the file content recorded at install time, identified by `installed_sha256` |
| **local** | the file currently in this project |
| **upstream** | the file in the target Throughstone release |

Classify the result:

| Classification | Meaning | Default action |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **already-current** | `local == upstream` | Report only. |
| **upstream-only** | `local == base`, upstream changed | Candidate for apply, still review risk. |
| **local-only** | local changed, upstream unchanged | Keep local; no update needed. |
| **diverged** | local changed and upstream changed | Manual review or merge; do not auto-apply. |
| **baseline-unknown** | install-time baseline is missing or cannot be verified | Report only; require manual review before any baseline is adopted or update is applied. |
| **untracked** | file is not in the manifest | Report only unless explicitly added to manifest. |
| **protected** | file is project-owned or generated | Never auto-apply. |
| **manifest-invalid** | checksum/path/ref is missing or inconsistent | Stop automatic actions; require manual comparison. |

Use precise wording: **"unchanged locally"** is acceptable; **"safe to apply"** is not.
For projects without a trustworthy install-time manifest, do not backfill the manifest by
treating today's local files as the original base. Mark those files `baseline-unknown` unless
their local content can be verified against a known installed upstream ref after bootstrap
normalization, or unless the user explicitly adopts a reviewed file as the new managed
baseline.

## 6. Mechanical Risk Signals

The updater should flag at least these signals:

- executable bit changed
- shell script changed
- file contains or changes `git`, `gh`, `ssh`, `curl`, `wget`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `chmod`,
  `chown`, `sudo`, `aws`, `kubectl`, or remote URLs
- status resolver or agent context changed (`status.sh`, `AGENTS.md`, `METHOD.md`)
- collaboration or numbering rules changed
- CI workflow changed
- file deletion or rename
- placeholder handling changed (the Throughstone project-placeholder token, generated project
  slug, repo paths)
- update group is incomplete
- affected repo has uncommitted changes

Mechanical signals do not replace the catalog; they catch omissions and force review.

## 7. Future Tooling Check Flow

1. Confirm the docs hub and workspace layout.
2. Read `Code/{{PROJECT}}-docs/.throughstone/manifest.yml` (or
   `.throughstone/manifest.yml` from inside the docs hub). If absent, use manual mode (§3)
   instead.
3. Fetch or locate the target Throughstone release metadata. If the process executes
   downloaded updater code, pin the release/ref and verify it using the release's published
   provenance mechanism before execution.
4. Read the upstream update catalog.
5. Build the three-way comparison for every manifest file.
6. Group related changes. If a group is incomplete, mark the whole group review-required.
7. Print a report with:
   - classification
   - bucket/policy
   - risk level and mechanical risk signals
   - human implications from the catalog
   - whether the update is future-only, review-required, manual-merge, or protected
8. Stop. The default tooling command must not write files.

## 8. Apply Rules

Only apply when all of these are true:

- user explicitly requested apply
- every affected repo has a clean working tree and index before the updater creates or switches
  branches and before it writes files
- upstream release/ref was selected; any downloaded executable updater code was verified using
  the release's published provenance mechanism
- file is not protected
- file is either `upstream-only` with a verified baseline or the user selected a manual merge
  result
- all files in the required update group are included

Branch rule:

- If the update meets the STEP threshold in §10, reserve a STEP and use the normal
  `step-NNNN-short-name` branch.
- If the update does not meet that threshold, use a dedicated scaffold-update branch so the
  change is still reviewable and easy to roll back.

This guide describes the process whether it is done manually or by future updater tooling.
Throughstone does **not** currently ship a `throughstone-update.sh` script. If/when one is
added, use command names that make the risk model clear, for example:

```bash
./throughstone-update.sh check
./throughstone-update.sh diff
./throughstone-update.sh apply --unchanged-local-only
./throughstone-update.sh apply METHOD.md scripts/status.sh
```

Avoid names like `--safe` or `--clean-only`; they imply more certainty than the updater has.

After apply:

1. Recompute and write manifest checksums for updated scaffold files.
2. Run the docs hub checks (`scripts/check.sh`).
3. Preserve the update report in the branch or commit message.
4. Tell the user what changed, what was skipped, and which manual review items remain.

## 9. Future Root Updater Shape

A future root updater may be tiny and replaceable:

1. locate the docs hub
2. read the manifest path
3. pin the requested upstream release/ref and verify executable updater code using the
   release's published provenance mechanism
4. run the verified updater from a temporary location
5. pass only project root, docs hub path, manifest path, and requested command

It must not store project state outside the manifest. If the root updater itself changes,
that update is reported and applied like any other script update.

## 10. When To Make It A STEP

Make a tracked STEP when the update:

- changes `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `status.sh`, collaboration rules, or STEP/ADR numbering
- touches more than one repo
- changes CI behavior
- requires manual merge decisions
- changes how future architecture sessions or planning sessions behave
- would affect an active team

The STEP's PLAN can be thin: point to this guide, list the update groups under review, and
define done as "report reviewed, selected updates applied, checks passed, manifest refreshed,
and skipped/protected files recorded."
