# Changelog

All notable changes to Throughstone are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Versions here
refer to the **Throughstone scaffold** (the method, templates, runbooks, and tooling), not to
any project built with it.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-03

A **scaffold-update process** release: it replaces the old "hand-copy upstream improvements"
guidance with a conservative update model for bootstrapped projects, and tightens bootstrap
and resume behavior before cutting the next tag.

### Added
- **Throughstone scaffold update guide** (`UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`): an
  advisory-first process for comparing a project to a newer Throughstone release, classifying
  files by bucket, reporting risk/implications, and applying only reviewed scaffold/process
  changes.
- **Manifest + catalog model** for future updater tooling: project state would live in
  `Code/{{PROJECT}}-docs/.throughstone/manifest.yml`; release implications would live in an
  upstream update catalog; the updater itself stays stateless.
- **Three-way comparison rules** (`base` / `local` / `upstream`) and classifications:
  already-current, upstream-only, local-only, diverged, untracked, protected, and
  manifest-invalid, with baseline-unknown handling for projects that lack a trustworthy
  install-time manifest.
- **Mechanical risk signals** for updater reports, including script changes, git/remote-touching
  commands, CI changes, placeholder handling, status resolver changes, incomplete update groups,
  and dirty affected repos.

### Changed
- `METHOD.md` is now **Method version 0.2 (beta)** and points scaffold updates to the new
  guide instead of suggesting direct hand-copying.
- The docs hub and template README now make clear that Throughstone improvements do not apply
  automatically after bootstrap, project-owned state is protected, and even script updates need
  review.
- STEP plans and substep prompts now remind agents to calibrate implementation work to the
  user's recorded experience level, not only architecture-session interviews.
- README and website quickstarts now lead with the direct clone flow and clarify GitHub template
  setup.

### Fixed
- `status.sh` now ignores HTML-commented example STEP rows so the next-action resolver does not
  treat documentation examples as real roadmap state.
- Bootstrap no longer leaves Throughstone's root README and changelog in generated projects.
- Mono-repo bootstrap now reuses a non-Throughstone root `origin`, while multi-repo workspaces
  remain detached until the user chooses remotes.
- Successful bootstrap remotes are recorded in `repos.yml` so `setup-workspace.sh` can clone
  sibling repos later.
- The method-check workflow can locate `check.sh` in both multi-repo and mono-repo layouts.
- Session 1.1's conditional-session summary includes privacy/compliance alongside native app
  and identity/auth.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-01

A **coding-standards** release: it reframes the shipped standards as customizable starting
points, broadens per-language coverage (adds Java and C#, plus concurrency/async and Python
idioms), and introduces three cross-cutting standards — SQL, Shell, and API design — wired into
the method so each surfaces at the right moment.

### New cross-cutting standards
- **SQL** (`coding-standards/sql.md`): naming, formatting (sqlfluff), query practices,
  parameterized-query safety, schema/DDL, and migrations — secondary to the language docs where
  they conflict.
- **Shell / Bash** (`coding-standards/shell.md`): strict mode, quoting/safety, naming/layout,
  idioms, and error handling (Google Shell Style Guide + ShellCheck/shfmt); the shebang is
  framed as an explicit, recorded project decision.
- **API design** (`coding-standards/api.md`): an opinionated, customizable house style for
  REST/HTTP APIs — resource naming, methods/status codes, RFC 3339 UTC timestamps, money as
  integer minor units, RFC 9457 problem-details errors, idempotency, and rate limits — with
  three per-project forks flagged (field casing, pagination, versioning), each with an ADR
  pointer. Complements each API's versioned contract artifact from the Interface Contracts session.

### Expanded per-language coverage
- **Java** (`java.md`) and **C#** (`csharp.md`) standards added.
- **Concurrency / async** sections added to Python, Rust, and TypeScript.
- **Python**: a Language idioms section.

### Customizable by default
- Shipped standards reframed as **customizable starting-point drafts** — both the per-language
  headers and the README — so teams treat them as a draft to edit, not law to obey.
- The **all-languages documentation rule** broadened to **fields/properties** (docstrings where
  the language documents them, e.g. Java fields, C# properties), public and private.

### Wiring
- The cross-cutting standards are reconciled by the **Test Strategy session** (kept only when each applies —
  a relational DB for SQL, shell scripts for Shell, an HTTP/REST boundary for API), listed in
  `coding-standards/README.md` and the `METHOD.md` hub gloss ("per-language plus cross-cutting"),
  and `templates/substep-prompt.md` nudges API-touching substeps to read `api.md`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-01

A **discoverability & docs-hygiene** release: it indexes the runbook and registry folders, adds
the **secrets-rotation runbook** the operate-time set was missing, makes the **session set
flexible** for added/conditional sessions, and closes plain-language gaps the method's own L1/L2
standard exposed.

### New operate-time runbook
- **Secrets rotation** (`runbooks/secrets-rotation.md`): scheduled rotation (inventory, cadence,
  no-downtime overlap, verify-then-revoke) and a **revoke-first** response to a suspected leak
  that hands off to the incident runbook. Operationalizes the threat-model §5 posture, mirroring
  how the dependency runbook operationalizes §6.

### Discoverability & docs hygiene
- **README indexes** for `runbooks/` (all five — purpose, when each fires + trigger phrase,
  governing section; STEP-shaped vs. operational) and `registries/` (machine-readable state,
  pointing at `repos.yml`'s own header rather than duplicating the schema); docs-hub rows now link
  both indexes.
- **Conditional-session naming is shown, not just described:** the by-name → file mapping inline
  in METHOD §4, and a copyable lettered-row example in the STEP-index seed.
- **Plain-language glosses** for jargon flagged against the method's own L1/L2 standard:
  API / OpenAPI / GraphQL / protobuf (session 1.3) and the RPO/RTO acronyms (session 1.8).

### Flexible session set
- **Session numbering no longer hardcodes the current set:** the conditional-doc rule and
  `status.sh` review-detection adapt to added sessions; dependency-bearing sessions
  (Scaling, UI, Infrastructure, Observability, Interface Contracts, and Test Strategy) read relevant
  conditional docs when present.
- **Glossary session** harvests terms from every architecture doc (including conditional docs above
  the core block), not a fixed range.
- **METHOD §4 "Adding a session" recipe** — conditional (zero-touch) vs. standard (renumber the
  cross-cutting review) wire-in checklist.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-31

This release **broadens the architecture sessions**, adds the **operate-time runbooks** the
method was missing, and introduces a **mechanical tooling layer** (scripts + CI) that enforces
rules the method previously trusted to discipline.

### Broader architecture coverage
- **Resilience & disaster recovery** is now first-class in the Infrastructure session (1.8):
  failure modes / single points of failure, an availability target, graceful degradation, and
  backups with RPO/RTO and restore-rehearsal.
- **Accessibility & internationalization** in the UI session (1.7): a concrete a11y target
  (WCAG 2.1 AA) plus a new i18n/l10n decision in the don't-foreclose spirit.
- **New conditional session — Privacy, compliance & data governance** for projects handling
  personal/regulated data (applicable regimes, data inventory, lawful basis/consent,
  retention/deletion, data-subject rights, residency & sub-processors).

### Stronger process discipline
- **Explicit conditional-session selection:** the kickoff now records a *Conditional sessions
  considered* table (Include / N-A + reason), so a skipped conditional is a deliberate, recorded
  choice — never a silent omission.
- **Milestone doc review:** at each phase/release the agent proactively raises release notes and
  end-user docs.
- **Documentation discipline** strengthened across the method; **testing guidance** sharpened
  (~80% coverage suggestion, per-step/substep test defaults).

### New operate-time runbooks
- **Release / Deploy / Rollback** — a rollback plan before you deploy, reversible migrations,
  staging-first, a post-deploy watch window.
- **Incident Response & Postmortem** — stabilize, then open an Incident STEP (RCA → find similar
  → fix & harden).
- **Dependencies & Supply Chain** — vet before adding (license / provenance / pin) and audit on
  the check-in cadence (vuln scan, lockfile hygiene, SBOM).

### Mechanical tooling (new)
- **`scripts/check.sh` — the "doctor":** flags *and suggests a fix for* duplicate STEP/ADR
  numbers, invalid statuses, missing architecture-doc frontmatter, and ADR registry/disk drift.
  Read-only; runnable in CI.
- **`scripts/status.sh` — next-action resolver:** prints "where you are · next action · check-in
  cadence" straight from disk; a resuming agent now runs it as its first action.
- **GitHub Actions CI starter:** a live method-integrity workflow (runs `check.sh`) plus a
  per-repo test-gate template.

### Other
- Maintainer contact moved to **hershey@throughstone.org**.
- A thin pointer **README at the docs-hub root**.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-31

Initial public release of the Throughstone scaffold — a starting structure for building
software **architecture-first** with an AI coding agent.

### Added
- **The method** (`METHOD.md`): the Phase → STEP → substep structure, architecture-first STEP-1
  (design docs + ADRs, no code), the two durable doc genres (architecture docs + ADRs),
  doc versioning, and the disk-derived next-action resolver.
- **Architecture sessions:** 13 core sessions (system overview through cross-cutting review)
  plus 2 conditional sessions (native app, identity & auth).
- **Runbooks:** the periodic check-in and multi-developer/agent collaboration.
- **Templates:** architecture docs, ADRs, STEP plans, substep prompts, repo READMEs, per-language
  coding standards, and the kickoff bootstrap.
- **Setup tooling:** the `init.sh` wizard and `setup-workspace.sh`; multi-repo and
  mono-repo-for-now layouts; license selection and stamping.
- **Brand assets** and the throughstone.org documentation site.
