# Changelog

All notable changes to Throughstone are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Versions here
refer to the **Throughstone scaffold** (the method, templates, runbooks, and tooling), not to
any project built with it.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-31

This release **broadens the architecture sessions**, adds the **operate-time runbooks** the
method was missing, and introduces a **mechanical tooling layer** (scripts + CI) that enforces
rules the method previously trusted to discipline.

### Broader architecture coverage
- **Resilience & disaster recovery** is now first-class in the Infrastructure session (1.8):
  failure modes / single points of failure, an availability target, graceful degradation, and
  backups with RPO/RTO and restore-rehearsal.
- **Accessibility & internationalization** in the UI session (1.7): a concrete a11y target
  (WCAG 2.1 AA) plus a new i18n/l10n decision in the don't-foreclose spirit.
- **New conditional session — Privacy, compliance & data governance** for projects handling
  personal/regulated data (applicable regimes, data inventory, lawful basis/consent,
  retention/deletion, data-subject rights, residency & sub-processors).

### Stronger process discipline
- **Explicit conditional-session selection:** the kickoff now records a *Conditional sessions
  considered* table (Include / N-A + reason), so a skipped conditional is a deliberate, recorded
  choice — never a silent omission.
- **Milestone doc review:** at each phase/release the agent proactively raises release notes and
  end-user docs.
- **Documentation discipline** strengthened across the method; **testing guidance** sharpened
  (~80% coverage suggestion, per-step/substep test defaults).

### New operate-time runbooks
- **Release / Deploy / Rollback** — a rollback plan before you deploy, reversible migrations,
  staging-first, a post-deploy watch window.
- **Incident Response & Postmortem** — stabilize, then open an Incident STEP (RCA → find similar
  → fix & harden).
- **Dependencies & Supply Chain** — vet before adding (license / provenance / pin) and audit on
  the check-in cadence (vuln scan, lockfile hygiene, SBOM).

### Mechanical tooling (new)
- **`scripts/check.sh` — the "doctor":** flags *and suggests a fix for* duplicate STEP/ADR
  numbers, invalid statuses, missing architecture-doc frontmatter, and ADR registry/disk drift.
  Read-only; runnable in CI.
- **`scripts/status.sh` — next-action resolver:** prints "where you are · next action · check-in
  cadence" straight from disk; a resuming agent now runs it as its first action.
- **GitHub Actions CI starter:** a live method-integrity workflow (runs `check.sh`) plus a
  per-repo test-gate template.

### Other
- Maintainer contact moved to **hershey@throughstone.org**.
- A thin pointer **README at the docs-hub root**.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-31

Initial public release of the Throughstone scaffold — a starting structure for building
software **architecture-first** with an AI coding agent.

### Added
- **The method** (`METHOD.md`): the Phase → STEP → substep structure, architecture-first STEP-1
  (design docs + ADRs, no code), the two durable doc genres (architecture docs + ADRs),
  doc versioning, and the disk-derived next-action resolver.
- **Architecture sessions:** 13 core sessions (system overview through cross-cutting review)
  plus 2 conditional sessions (native app, identity & auth).
- **Runbooks:** the periodic check-in and multi-developer/agent collaboration.
- **Templates:** architecture docs, ADRs, STEP plans, substep prompts, repo READMEs, per-language
  coding standards, and the kickoff bootstrap.
- **Setup tooling:** the `init.sh` wizard and `setup-workspace.sh`; multi-repo and
  mono-repo-for-now layouts; license selection and stamping.
- **Brand assets** and the throughstone.org documentation site.
